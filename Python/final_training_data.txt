ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others
KING HENRY IV
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
KING HENRY IV
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
KING HENRY IV
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
KING HENRY IV
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
KING HENRY IV
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
KING HENRY IV
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,
KING HENRY IV
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
KING HENRY IV
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
KING HENRY IV
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
KING HENRY IV
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
KING HENRY IV
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
KING HENRY IV
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
KING HENRY IV
And furious close of civil butchery
KING HENRY IV
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
KING HENRY IV
March all one way and be no more opposed
KING HENRY IV
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
KING HENRY IV
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
KING HENRY IV
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
KING HENRY IV
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
KING HENRY IV
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
KING HENRY IV
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
KING HENRY IV
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
KING HENRY IV
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
KING HENRY IV
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
KING HENRY IV
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
KING HENRY IV
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
KING HENRY IV
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
KING HENRY IV
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
KING HENRY IV
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
KING HENRY IV
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
KING HENRY IV
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
KING HENRY IV
What yesternight our council did decree
KING HENRY IV
In forwarding this dear expedience.
WESTMORELAND
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
WESTMORELAND
And many limits of the charge set down
WESTMORELAND
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
WESTMORELAND
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,
WESTMORELAND
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
WESTMORELAND
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
WESTMORELAND
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
WESTMORELAND
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
WESTMORELAND
A thousand of his people butchered,
WESTMORELAND
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
WESTMORELAND
Such beastly shameless transformation,
WESTMORELAND
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
WESTMORELAND
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
KING HENRY IV
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
KING HENRY IV
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
WESTMORELAND
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,
WESTMORELAND
For more uneven and unwelcome news
WESTMORELAND
Came from the north and thus it did import:
WESTMORELAND
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
WESTMORELAND
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
WESTMORELAND
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
WESTMORELAND
At Holmedon met,
WESTMORELAND
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
WESTMORELAND
As by discharge of their artillery,
WESTMORELAND
And shape of likelihood, the news was told,
WESTMORELAND
For he that brought them, in the very heat
WESTMORELAND
And pride of their contention did take horse,
WESTMORELAND
Uncertain of the issue any way.
KING HENRY IV
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
KING HENRY IV
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
KING HENRY IV
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
KING HENRY IV
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
KING HENRY IV
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
KING HENRY IV
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
KING HENRY IV
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
KING HENRY IV
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
KING HENRY IV
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
KING HENRY IV
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
KING HENRY IV
To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,
KING HENRY IV
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
KING HENRY IV
And is not this an honourable spoil?
KING HENRY IV
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
WESTMORELAND
In faith,
WESTMORELAND
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
KING HENRY IV
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
KING HENRY IV
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
KING HENRY IV
Should be the father to so blest a son,
KING HENRY IV
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
KING HENRY IV
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,
KING HENRY IV
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
KING HENRY IV
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
KING HENRY IV
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
KING HENRY IV
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
KING HENRY IV
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
KING HENRY IV
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
KING HENRY IV
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
KING HENRY IV
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
KING HENRY IV
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
KING HENRY IV
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
KING HENRY IV
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
KING HENRY IV
To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,
KING HENRY IV
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
WESTMORELAND
This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,
WESTMORELAND
Malevolent to you in all aspects,
WESTMORELAND
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
WESTMORELAND
The crest of youth against your dignity.
KING HENRY IV
But I have sent for him to answer this,
KING HENRY IV
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
KING HENRY IV
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
KING HENRY IV
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
KING HENRY IV
Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:
KING HENRY IV
But come yourself with speed to us again,
KING HENRY IV
For more is to be said and to be done
KING HENRY IV
Than out of anger can be uttered.
WESTMORELAND
I will, my liege.
WESTMORELAND
Exeunt
WESTMORELAND
SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
WESTMORELAND
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
PRINCE HENRY
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
PRINCE HENRY
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
PRINCE HENRY
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
PRINCE HENRY
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
PRINCE HENRY
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
PRINCE HENRY
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
PRINCE HENRY
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
PRINCE HENRY
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
PRINCE HENRY
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
PRINCE HENRY
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
PRINCE HENRY
the time of the day.
FALSTAFF
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take
FALSTAFF
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
FALSTAFF
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
FALSTAFF
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
FALSTAFF
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
FALSTAFF
thou wilt have none,--
PRINCE HENRY
What, none?
FALSTAFF
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
FALSTAFF
prologue to an egg and butter.
PRINCE HENRY
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
FALSTAFF
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
FALSTAFF
us that are squires of the night's body be called
FALSTAFF
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
FALSTAFF
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
FALSTAFF
moon, and let men say we be men of good government,
FALSTAFF
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
FALSTAFF
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
PRINCE HENRY
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the
PRINCE HENRY
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
PRINCE HENRY
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
PRINCE HENRY
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
PRINCE HENRY
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
PRINCE HENRY
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with
PRINCE HENRY
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'
PRINCE HENRY
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
PRINCE HENRY
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
FALSTAFF
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
FALSTAFF
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
PRINCE HENRY
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
PRINCE HENRY
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
FALSTAFF
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
FALSTAFF
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
FALSTAFF
buff jerkin?
PRINCE HENRY
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
FALSTAFF
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
FALSTAFF
time and oft.
PRINCE HENRY
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
FALSTAFF
No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
PRINCE HENRY
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,
PRINCE HENRY
and where it would not, I have used my credit.
FALSTAFF
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
FALSTAFF
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
FALSTAFF
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
FALSTAFF
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
FALSTAFF
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
FALSTAFF
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
PRINCE HENRY
No, thou shalt.
FALSTAFF
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
PRINCE HENRY
Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
PRINCE HENRY
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
FALSTAFF
Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my
FALSTAFF
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
FALSTAFF
you.
PRINCE HENRY
For obtaining of suits?
FALSTAFF
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
FALSTAFF
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
FALSTAFF
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
PRINCE HENRY
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
FALSTAFF
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
PRINCE HENRY
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
PRINCE HENRY
Moor-ditch?
FALSTAFF
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
FALSTAFF
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
FALSTAFF
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
FALSTAFF
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
FALSTAFF
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
FALSTAFF
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
FALSTAFF
street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet
FALSTAFF
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and
FALSTAFF
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
PRINCE HENRY
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the
PRINCE HENRY
streets, and no man regards it.
FALSTAFF
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
FALSTAFF
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
FALSTAFF
me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
FALSTAFF
thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man
FALSTAFF
should speak truly, little better than one of the
FALSTAFF
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
FALSTAFF
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
FALSTAFF
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
FALSTAFF
Christendom.
PRINCE HENRY
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
FALSTAFF
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I
FALSTAFF
do not, call me villain and baffle me.
PRINCE HENRY
I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying
PRINCE HENRY
to purse-taking.
FALSTAFF
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a
FALSTAFF
man to labour in his vocation.
FALSTAFF
Enter POINS
FALSTAFF
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
FALSTAFF
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
FALSTAFF
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
FALSTAFF
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
FALSTAFF
a true man.
PRINCE HENRY
Good morrow, Ned.
POINS
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
POINS
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
POINS
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
POINS
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
POINS
and a cold capon's leg?
PRINCE HENRY
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
PRINCE HENRY
his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of
PRINCE HENRY
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
POINS
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
PRINCE HENRY
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
POINS
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
POINS
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
POINS
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
POINS
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
POINS
for you all, you have horses for yourselves:
POINS
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
POINS
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
POINS
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
POINS
your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry
POINS
at home and be hanged.
FALSTAFF
Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,
FALSTAFF
I'll hang you for going.
POINS
You will, chops?
FALSTAFF
Hal, wilt thou make one?
PRINCE HENRY
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
FALSTAFF
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
FALSTAFF
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
FALSTAFF
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
PRINCE HENRY
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
FALSTAFF
Why, that's well said.
PRINCE HENRY
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
FALSTAFF
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
PRINCE HENRY
I care not.
POINS
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
POINS
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
POINS
that he shall go.
FALSTAFF
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
FALSTAFF
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
FALSTAFF
move and what he hears may be believed, that the
FALSTAFF
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
FALSTAFF
thief, for the poor abuses of the time want
FALSTAFF
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
PRINCE HENRY
Exit Falstaff
POINS
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
POINS
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
POINS
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
POINS
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
POINS
yourself and I will not be there, and when they
POINS
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
POINS
this head off from my shoulders.
PRINCE HENRY
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
POINS
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
POINS
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
POINS
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
POINS
upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have
POINS
no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
PRINCE HENRY
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
PRINCE HENRY
horses, by our habits and by every other
PRINCE HENRY
appointment, to be ourselves.
POINS
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
POINS
in the wood, our vizards we will change after we
POINS
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
POINS
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
PRINCE HENRY
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
POINS
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
POINS
true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the
POINS
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
POINS
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
POINS
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
POINS
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
POINS
least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what
POINS
extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this
POINS
lies the jest.
PRINCE HENRY
Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
PRINCE HENRY
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,
PRINCE HENRY
there I'll sup. Farewell.
POINS
Farewell, my lord.
POINS
Exit Poins
PRINCE HENRY
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
PRINCE HENRY
The unyoked humour of your idleness:
PRINCE HENRY
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
PRINCE HENRY
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
PRINCE HENRY
To smother up his beauty from the world,
PRINCE HENRY
That, when he please again to be himself,
PRINCE HENRY
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
PRINCE HENRY
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
PRINCE HENRY
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
PRINCE HENRY
If all the year were playing holidays,
PRINCE HENRY
To sport would be as tedious as to work,
PRINCE HENRY
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
PRINCE HENRY
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
PRINCE HENRY
So, when this loose behavior I throw off
PRINCE HENRY
And pay the debt I never promised,
PRINCE HENRY
By how much better than my word I am,
PRINCE HENRY
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,
PRINCE HENRY
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
PRINCE HENRY
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
PRINCE HENRY
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
PRINCE HENRY
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
PRINCE HENRY
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,
PRINCE HENRY
Redeeming time when men think least I will.
PRINCE HENRY
Exit
PRINCE HENRY
SCENE III. London. The palace.
PRINCE HENRY
Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others
KING HENRY IV
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
KING HENRY IV
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
KING HENRY IV
And you have found me, for accordingly
KING HENRY IV
You tread upon my patience: but be sure
KING HENRY IV
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
KING HENRY IV
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,
KING HENRY IV
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
KING HENRY IV
And therefore lost that title of respect
KING HENRY IV
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
EARL OF WORCESTER
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
EARL OF WORCESTER
The scourge of greatness to be used on it,
EARL OF WORCESTER
And that same greatness too which our own hands
EARL OF WORCESTER
Have holp to make so portly.
NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord.--
KING HENRY IV
Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see
KING HENRY IV
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
KING HENRY IV
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
KING HENRY IV
And majesty might never yet endure
KING HENRY IV
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
KING HENRY IV
You have good leave to leave us: when we need
KING HENRY IV
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
KING HENRY IV
Exit Worcester
KING HENRY IV
You were about to speak.
KING HENRY IV
To North
NORTHUMBERLAND
Yea, my good lord.
NORTHUMBERLAND
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
NORTHUMBERLAND
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
NORTHUMBERLAND
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
NORTHUMBERLAND
As is deliver'd to your majesty:
NORTHUMBERLAND
Either envy, therefore, or misprison
NORTHUMBERLAND
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
HOTSPUR
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
HOTSPUR
But I remember, when the fight was done,
HOTSPUR
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
HOTSPUR
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
HOTSPUR
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
HOTSPUR
Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd
HOTSPUR
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,
HOTSPUR
He was perfumed like a milliner,
HOTSPUR
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
HOTSPUR
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
HOTSPUR
He gave his nose and took't away again,
HOTSPUR
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
HOTSPUR
Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,
HOTSPUR
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
HOTSPUR
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
HOTSPUR
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
HOTSPUR
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
HOTSPUR
With many holiday and lady terms
HOTSPUR
He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded
HOTSPUR
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
HOTSPUR
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
HOTSPUR
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
HOTSPUR
Out of my grief and my impatience,
HOTSPUR
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
HOTSPUR
He should or he should not, for he made me mad
HOTSPUR
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
HOTSPUR
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
HOTSPUR
Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
HOTSPUR
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
HOTSPUR
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,
HOTSPUR
And that it was great pity, so it was,
HOTSPUR
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
HOTSPUR
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
HOTSPUR
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
HOTSPUR
So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,
HOTSPUR
He would himself have been a soldier.
HOTSPUR
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
HOTSPUR
I answer'd indirectly, as I said,
HOTSPUR
And I beseech you, let not his report
HOTSPUR
Come current for an accusation
HOTSPUR
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
SIR WALTER BLUNT
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
SIR WALTER BLUNT
To such a person and in such a place,
SIR WALTER BLUNT
At such a time, with all the rest retold,
SIR WALTER BLUNT
May reasonably die and never rise
SIR WALTER BLUNT
To do him wrong or any way impeach
SIR WALTER BLUNT
What then he said, so he unsay it now.
KING HENRY IV
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
KING HENRY IV
But with proviso and exception,
KING HENRY IV
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
KING HENRY IV
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,
KING HENRY IV
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
KING HENRY IV
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
KING HENRY IV
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
KING HENRY IV
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
KING HENRY IV
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
KING HENRY IV
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
KING HENRY IV
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
KING HENRY IV
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
KING HENRY IV
No, on the barren mountains let him starve,
KING HENRY IV
For I shall never hold that man my friend
KING HENRY IV
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
KING HENRY IV
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
HOTSPUR
Revolted Mortimer!
HOTSPUR
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
HOTSPUR
But by the chance of war, to prove that true
HOTSPUR
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
HOTSPUR
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
HOTSPUR
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
HOTSPUR
In single opposition, hand to hand,
HOTSPUR
He did confound the best part of an hour
HOTSPUR
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
HOTSPUR
Three times they breathed and three times did
HOTSPUR
they drink,
HOTSPUR
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,
HOTSPUR
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
HOTSPUR
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
HOTSPUR
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
HOTSPUR
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
HOTSPUR
Never did base and rotten policy
HOTSPUR
Colour her working with such deadly wounds,
HOTSPUR
Nor could the noble Mortimer
HOTSPUR
Receive so many, and all willingly:
HOTSPUR
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
KING HENRY IV
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,
KING HENRY IV
He never did encounter with Glendower:
KING HENRY IV
I tell thee,
KING HENRY IV
He durst as well have met the devil alone
KING HENRY IV
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
KING HENRY IV
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
KING HENRY IV
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
KING HENRY IV
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
KING HENRY IV
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
KING HENRY IV
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
KING HENRY IV
We licence your departure with your son.
KING HENRY IV
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
KING HENRY IV
Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train
HOTSPUR
An if the devil come and roar for them,
HOTSPUR
I will not send them: I will after straight
HOTSPUR
And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,
HOTSPUR
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
NORTHUMBERLAND
What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
NORTHUMBERLAND
Here comes your uncle.
NORTHUMBERLAND
Re-enter WORCESTER
HOTSPUR
Speak of Mortimer!
HOTSPUR
'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
HOTSPUR
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
HOTSPUR
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
HOTSPUR
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
HOTSPUR
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
HOTSPUR
As high in the air as this unthankful king,
HOTSPUR
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
NORTHUMBERLAND
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
EARL OF WORCESTER
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
HOTSPUR
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,
HOTSPUR
And when I urged the ransom once again
HOTSPUR
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
HOTSPUR
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
HOTSPUR
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
EARL OF WORCESTER
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
EARL OF WORCESTER
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
NORTHUMBERLAND
He was, I heard the proclamation:
NORTHUMBERLAND
And then it was when the unhappy king,
NORTHUMBERLAND
--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
NORTHUMBERLAND
Upon his Irish expedition,
NORTHUMBERLAND
From whence he intercepted did return
NORTHUMBERLAND
To be deposed and shortly murdered.
EARL OF WORCESTER
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
EARL OF WORCESTER
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
HOTSPUR
But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then
HOTSPUR
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
HOTSPUR
Heir to the crown?
NORTHUMBERLAND
He did, myself did hear it.
HOTSPUR
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
HOTSPUR
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
HOTSPUR
But shall it be that you, that set the crown
HOTSPUR
Upon the head of this forgetful man
HOTSPUR
And for his sake wear the detested blot
HOTSPUR
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
HOTSPUR
That you a world of curses undergo,
HOTSPUR
Being the agents, or base second means,
HOTSPUR
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
